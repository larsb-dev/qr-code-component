## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM

### What I learned

I've rebuilt this project, because I deleted my previous solution. Because of that, I have not really learned anything new except that I've applied BEM notation after a long time.

### Continued development

Looking forward to some some more challenging projects.
